# X-Team 101 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will discuss what neesds to be done, and the team leader will divide up the work fairly and evenly based on
team member strengths.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will communicate effectively using GroupMe and track progress/completion of tasks within Trello. 


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
If a group member is struggling with their task, they will notify the rest of the group as soon as possible
so that we can work as a team to resolve the issue.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
The team leader will keep track of deadlines and remind/check-in with team members to ensure everything is done.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
